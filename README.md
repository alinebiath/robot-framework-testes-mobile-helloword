# Automated tests for Android app with Robot Framework

- Tests applied in an Android application called "Hello World" 
- App available for free by Haejoong Lee in his repository at: https://github.com/Anexinet/RobotFrameworkDemo-Android
- The script was developed to test application in physical device and don't perform in emulators. 
- For this, the code must be adapted.

### Pre-conditions for the tests
- Clone the project
- Install the app in device
- Install Python 2.7.15
- Install Appium
- Use an ASCII editor of your preference (i.e. VSCode, Atom, RIDE, etc)</br>

### Installing required Python libraries
With the pre-conditions satisfied, the libraries required to run the tests must be installed. At the terminal, execute the command below:
```sh

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```sh

```
This command will perform pip installation of what is required by the Robot Framework specified in the <i>requirements.txt file</i>.</br>
